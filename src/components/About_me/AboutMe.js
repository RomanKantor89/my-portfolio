            <p>
              Hello, I'm Roman, an enthusiastic Software Developer with almost 3 years of experience in automation, alongside a profound fascination with web technologies and tools. 
            </p><br/>
            <p>
              My development journey commenced at Seneca College, where I pursued a Bachelor of Technology (Honours) for four years. This period was marked by two pivotal Co-Op terms that significantly shaped my career path. My initial Co-Op at Info-Tech Research Group saw me contributing to an agile team; there, I played a key role in enhancing service offerings and broadening client categories. My subsequent Co-Op, and eventual post-graduation employer, was Peraso Technologiesâ€”a company at the forefront of millimeter wave technology. Peraso's groundbreaking work in wireless solutions not only captured my interest but also offered me a platform to contribute to the evolution of wireless communications.
            </p><br/>
            <p>
              In my tenure at Peraso, I've honed my skills in JavaScript for automation tasks, while during my free time delving into React for front-end development and NodeJS/Firebase for backend API construction in personal projects, including the development of this portfolio and an entertainment website for a client.
            </p><br/>
            <p>
              I encourage you to explore my resume for a detailed overview of my experiences, and to take a look at my portfolio to get a sense of my work's breadth. I am keen on exploring new project opportunities or collaborations. Let's &nbsp;
