            <p>
              I am a fourth year software development degree student; 
              however, you already probably knew this information from my resume. 
              In this page I would like you to meet me not as a set of skills, but rather from a personal perspective. 
            </p><br/>
            <p>
              I love coding and although I am a late bloomer in this field, 
              I am glad I discovered my passion towards coding sooner than later. 
              I am a very social person, and therefore I have many friends with whom I like spending my free time, 
              I am also very easy going and very easy to get along with. 
              My favorite stress relieving activity is to jog in the summer time 
              and exercise in the gym. 
            </p><br/>
            <p>
                I am very excited for my new career path that I am fully engaged in, 
                and I canâ€™t wait to see where it is going to take me. 
                Software development field is the challenge I have been missing in my life to feel accomplished, 
                and I finally feel like I am on the right path.
